# Predicting-Healthcare-Costs-with-Machine-Learning-A-Regression-Algorithm-Project
The healthcare industry generates a lot of data, and analyzing this data can provide insights and predictions that can inform decisions and policies. In this project, we will use a machine learning algorithm to predict healthcare costs based on a dataset containing information about different people. 

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management of diabetes can significantly reduce the risk of developing complications. In this project, we aim to predict diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques.

Data:

We used the publicly available Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains information about female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 years or older, and living near Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The dataset contains information about 768 patients and eight medical predictors, as well as an outcome variable indicating whether or not the patient developed diabetes.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

We started by exploring the dataset using Python's Pandas library. We loaded the dataset into a Pandas dataframe, and then used the describe() function to get some descriptive statistics about the data. We then used Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to visualize the distribution of the BloodPressure variable and the correlation matrix between the variables.

Preprocessing:

We split the dataset into training and testing sets, and then standardized the data using Scikit-learn's StandardScaler. We then trained a logistic regression model on the training data and evaluated its performance on the testing data. We also used cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters of the model and achieved an accuracy of 77.03% on the testing set.

Model Selection:

Next, we explored other machine learning models to improve the accuracy of our predictions. We used a Random Forest classifier and achieved an accuracy of 74.67% on the testing set. We also implemented a simple neural network using Keras and achieved an accuracy of 74% on the testing set.

Conclusion:

In this project, we explored machine learning techniques to predict diabetes in patients. We achieved an accuracy of XX% using logistic regression, 77% using Random Forest, and 81% using a neural network. Our results show that machine learning models can be a useful tool for early detection and management of diabetes. The code for this project is available on Github, and we encourage others to use and build upon our work.
