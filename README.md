# Predicting-Healthcare-Costs-with-Machine-Learning-A-Regression-Algorithm-Project
The healthcare industry generates a lot of data, and analyzing this data can provide insights and predictions that can inform decisions and policies. In this project, we will use a machine learning algorithm to predict healthcare costs based on a dataset containing information about different people.
